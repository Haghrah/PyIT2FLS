## Defining Mamdani IT2FLSs
One of the most common models of the fuzzy systems is Mamdani model. In constrast with TSK model, the inputs and outputs of the system in Mamdani model are fuzzy sets. There are two ways to create interval type 2 mamdani fuzzy systems using PyIT2FLS:

1. Using **_IT2FLS_** class
2. Using **_Mamdani_** class

In the following, it will be introduced how to use these two classes.

### **_IT2FLS_** class


### **_Mamdani_** class
