Typereduction
========

Typereduction library contains the Ctypes based implementations of type reduction algorithms ONLY for IT2FSs. It should be noted that some parts of the original type reduction algorithms have been edited for improving the execution speed.

### Connecting with PyIT2FLS

PyIT2FLS automatically detects whether the Typereduction toolkit has been installed or not and uses it in computations if installed.
