## Installation
PyIT2FLS can be installed by unzipping the source code in a directory and using this command:

    (sudo) python3 setup.py install

Or you can use pip3:

    (sudo) pip3 install --upgrade pyit2fls

## Versions

### Features coming up in the next version
- Exception handling.
- Supporting Generalized Type 2 Fuzzy Sets and Systems.

### Some notes on version 0.7.8
- Some bugs have been fixed in this version.

### Some notes on version 0.7.0-0.7.7
- Supporting fuzzy matrices and related operators.
- Faster IT2 FLS evaluation (Please visit [typereduction](https://github.com/Haghrah/PyIT2FLS/tree/master/typereduction) package).
- Introduction of emphasize function for both type 1 and interval type 2 fuzzy sets (See [16th](https://github.com/Haghrah/PyIT2FLS/blob/master/examples/ex_16.py) example).
- New options while calling plot functions (**_T1FS.plot_**, **_IT2FS.plot_**, **_T1FS_plot_**, **_IT2FS_plot_**, and **_TR_plot_**) have been added.
	- Users can specify the output file format (png, eps, pdf, etc.) while calling the plot function by setting the **_ext_** input parameter (with **_pdf_** default value).
	- Users can edit the status of the grid in the output plot by setting the **_grid_** input parameter (with **_True_** default value).
	- Users can edit the x and y-labels by setting the input parameters **_xlabel_** and **_ylabel_**, respectively. The default value of the **_xlabel_** is **_Domain_**, and the default value of the **_ylabel_** is **_Membership degree_**.

- There are some deprecated functions and classes. After releasing version 1.0.0, deprecated functions and classes will no longer be supported. So:
	- Please use the function **_IT2FS_LGaussian_UncertStd_** instead of **_L_IT2FS_Gaussian_UncertStd_**.
	- Please use the function **_IT2FS_RGaussian_UncertStd_** instead of **_R_IT2FS_Gaussian_UncertStd_**.
	- Please use the class **_IT2Mamdani_** instead of **_IT2FLS_**.
	- Please use the class **_IT2Mamdani_** instead of **_Mamdani_**.
	- Please use the class **_IT2TSK_** instead of **_TSK_**.

### Some notes on version 0.6.1
- Some bugs have been fixed in this version.

### Some notes on version 0.6
- Supporting Type 1 Fuzzy Sets and Systems.
- Supporting elliptic and semi-elliptic membership functions.
- Supporting generalized bell shaped membership function.
- Supporting many new t-norms and s-norms.
- Some bugs are fixed in this version.

### Some notes on version 0.5
- Supporting both Mamdani and TSK systems.
- Some bugs have been fixed in this vesion. Now, it is possible to use different domains for FLS inputs and outputs.

### Some notes on version 0.4
- Some bugs have been fixed in this version especially in type reduction algorithms. I would like to say thanks to Dr. K.B Badri Narayanan for reporting the errors.
- Some new IT2FSs have been added to the toolkit.
- In previous versions, the height of the IT2FS_Gaussian_UncertStd and IT2FS_Gaussian_UncertMean IT2FSs was fixed to 1, by default. But in the new version, user must give the height value in the parameters list as the last element.

## Docstrings
Further information about the functions and classes in the PyIT2FLS are accessible by docstrings. After importing a function or class, they can be seen by calling the help function. For example:

```python
>>> from pyit2fls import IT2FS_Gaussian_UncertStd
>>> help(IT2FS_Gaussian_UncertStd)
```
